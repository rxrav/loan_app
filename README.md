## This is a hypothetical app processing loans for applicants based on some criteria

Here we simulate some scenarios using application amount limit, age, and credit score fetched from an external service

The intention of this app is to demonstrate
- Dead simple dependency injection
- Mocking (useing interfaces in Go and mockgen library)
- Building docker images
- Integration testing using testcontainers (Postgres, external APIs)
